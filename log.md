# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 71: March 13, 2018

Today's Progress: Working on the Pomodoro Clock.

Thoughts: A few small wins! The clock is now counting down and the sliders now can be used to change the displayed time. Making the play/pause button work for pauses now!

### Day 70: March 12, 2018

Today's Progress: Working on the Pomodoro Clock.

Thoughts: Still working on fixing the countdown code. I understand what the issue it, but I am honestly not sure how to correct it. I need a variable to calculate the time 25 minutes from the current time when the button is clicked, but it appears to be constantly increasing that time which is causing the count to go up rather than down. :(

### Day 69: March 11, 2018

Today's Progress: Working on the Pomodoro Clock.

Thoughts: Rewrote the code to use getTime() method which is more precise than manually counting seconds (prone to slowness and inaccurancy). Now my countdown starts when the button is clicked, but it is counting up!!

### Day 68: March 10, 2018

Today's Progress: Working on the Pomodoro Clock.

Thoughts: Have the 25 minute countdown working now, but trying to get it to start when a button is pushed. Also adding sliders so the user can change the length of the session.

### Day 67: March 9, 2018

Today's Progress: Working on the Pomodoro Clock.

Thoughts: Got the UI laid out and starting working on the Javscript timer. I can get it to do a coundown from a future date, but need it to countdown just a set amount of minutes!

### Day 64: March 6, 2018

Today's Progress: Working on Javascript Calculator Project.

Thoughts: Bug squashing! I have rewritten and simplified a lot of code and am no longer previewing the calculation that is input. It is a simplier calculator, but problems are getting solved.

### Day 63: March 5, 2018

Today's Progress: Working on Javascript Calculator Project.

Thoughts: My list of bugs is expanding, gah! I've found at least four more issues (input length exceeding field, multiple decimals points in numbers, multiple operations) that I've logged and have been working on.

### Day 62: March 4, 2018

Today's Progress: Working on Javascript Calculator Project.

Thoughts: The calculator is starting to work quite well! I looked at using the eval() method to evaluate the string containing the calculation into a result, but learned this had a number of issues and security flaws. Ended up importing the math.js library which works very well with proper BEDMAS. Just a few bugs to solve now with how numbers are displaying during the lifecycle of the calculation.

Link to work: n/a

### Day 41: February 11, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued advanced FCC algorithm challenges.

Thoughts: Ended up getting stuck on the Code Wars challenge. Gah! Managed to solve it and then puzzled at the Symmetric Difference challenge again with little progress.

Link to work: n/a

### Day 40: February 10, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued advanced FCC algorithm challenges.

Thoughts: So  thought I solved the Symmetric Difference challenge - but nope! My solution removed all values that appear more than once, which tecnically isn't a Symmetric Difference. Had to take a break and worked on a Code Wars challenge.

Link to work: n/a

### Day 39: February 9, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued advanced FCC algorithm challenges.

Thoughts: Working on a challenge to return Symmetric Difference of multiple arrays. It's been a disapointing week on the job front - a great Jr Dev job came up with company (entry level), and I was told they would not consider another location for it.

Link to work: n/a

### Day 38: February 8, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued advanced FCC algorithm challenges.

Thoughts: Completed the phone numbers challenge! My solution wasn't very elegant as I couldn't get it completed only with a regex and resorted to some other things to validate the numbers, but it works. Also finished another challenge to manipulate JSON.

Link to work: n/a

### Day 37: February 7, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued advanced FCC algorithm challenges.

Thoughts: Got all but 2 of the tests passing now on the phone number validation. These last two are tricky to make false without making valid numbers false too!

Link to work: n/a

### Day 31: February 1, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued intermediate FCC algorithm challenges.

Thoughts: Finished another challenge, and went back to the Smallest Common one. Feel like I have the right ideas, but I cannot get the syntax working to test them out. Still not solved!

Link to work: n/a

### Day 30: January 31, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued intermediate FCC algorithm challenges.

Thoughts: Feel like I've hit a real wall. Still cannot make progress on the Smallest Common challenge - looking through different solutions, none of them make sense the entire way through that I can understand how they were solved. :( Skipped ahead to work on other challenges.

Link to work: n/a


### Day 29: January 30, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued intermediate FCC algorithm challenges.

### Day 10: January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Those last few tweaks...

**Thoughts:** I want to improve the Wikipedia viewer so that a different colour is attached to each search result and makes a satisfying rainbow of awesomeness on the page. I also want the input field to be automatically active and the search button to engage upon keying 'enter'. Neither of these last UX tweaks are happening easily and I gave up after some time to do more Codewars.

**Link to work:** <a href ="https://codepen.io/abbywilson/pen/rpYrQO?editors=1010">Wikipedia Viewer</a>

### Day 9: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: The Wikipedia Viewer is functioning!

**Thoughts:** Finally got things configured so the search term entered in the input field feeds into the API that calls to Wikipedia and brings back up to 10 search results in nicely styled boxes. I've checked all the boxes on the user stories!

**Link to work:** <a href ="https://codepen.io/abbywilson/pen/rpYrQO?editors=1010">Wikipedia Viewer</a>

### Day 7: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got the Wikipedia API working, woooo!

**Thoughts:** The problem was silly me, trying to follow the documentation that warned a special header needed to be included in all API requests. Once I removed that, the request started returning data. Further formatting and tweaking is required!

**Link to work:** <a href ="https://codepen.io/abbywilson/pen/rpYrQO?editors=1010">Wikipedia Viewer</a>


### Day 6: January 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the Wikipedia viewer and solved another 6kyu CW Kata.

**Thoughts:** This was one of those days with a lot of trouble-shooting and researching, and not a lot of visible progress. Once again, a lot of tweaking is required to get the API to work.

**Link to work:** <a href ="https://codepen.io/abbywilson/pen/rpYrQO?editors=1010">Wikipedia Viewer</a>

### Day 5: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the weather app and completed several Codewars katas. Also started the next FCC challenge - to build a Wikipedia viewer.

**Thoughts:** Completed formatting the weather app and called it done! Also completed several challenging katas, including on that required learning about dates in JavaScript.

**Link to work:** <a href ="https://codepen.io/abbywilson/pen/QagRxY?editors=1011">Local Weather</a>

### Day 4: January 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Great day of progress! The weather app is almost complete, just need to solve an issue with a local variable to make the final effects work!

**Thoughts:** Got the Google API to change the geocode to display the city/provice - nice! Also programmed the toggle switch that converts Celcius to Fahrenheit when it's clicled. Also did a lot of work on formatting and creating different effects for different types of weather.

**Link to work:** n/a

### Day 1: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the FreeCodeCamp challenge to build a weather app

**Thoughts:** Was able to draft the intial html and css and get JS to prompt for the user's geolocaion; however, I've hit a roadblock with feeding the geolocation coordinates into the weather API. I can't even get them to display on the page!

**Link to work:** <a href ="https://codepen.io/abbywilson/pen/QagRxY?editors=1011">Local Weather</a>

### Day 0: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed my FreeCodeCamp challenge for the Random Quote Machine.

**Thoughts:** My biggest challenge was to get the Tweet button to dynamically respond to the content that is coming through the quote API. The content of the draft Tweet should change depending on what quote is generated through the API. Finally got this to work!
