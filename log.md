### Day 1: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the FreeCodeCamp challenge to build a weather app

**Thoughts:** Was able to draft the intial html and css and get JS to prompt for the user's geolocaion; however, I've hit a roadblock with feeding the geolocation coordinates into the weather API. I can't even get them to display on the page!

### Day 0: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed my FreeCodeCamp challenge for the Random Quote Machine.

**Thoughts:** My biggest challenge was to get the Tweet button to dynamically respond to the content that is coming through the quote API. The content of the draft Tweet should change depending on what quote is generated through the API. Finally got this to work!
