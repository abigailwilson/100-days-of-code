# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my FreeCodeCamp challenge for the Random Quote Machine. 

**Thoughts:** Struggling to get the 'Tweet' button to dynamically respond to the content that is coming through the quote API. The content of the draft Tweet should change depending on what quote is generated through the API.
