# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 6: January 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the Wikipedia viewer and solved another 6kyu CW Kata.

**Thoughts:** This was one of those days with a lot of trouble-shooting and researching, and not a lot of visible progress. Once again, a lot of tweaking is required to get the API to work.

### Day 5: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the weather app and completed several Codewars katas. Also started the next FCC challenge - to build a Wikipedia viewer.

**Thoughts:** Completed formatting the weather app and called it done! Also completed several challenging katas, including on that required learning about dates in JavaScript.

### Day 4: January 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Great day of progress! The weather app is almost complete, just need to solve an issue with a local variable to make the final effects work!

**Thoughts:** Got the Google API to change the geocode to display the city/provice - nice! Also programmed the toggle switch that converts Celcius to Fahrenheit when it's clicled. Also did a lot of work on formatting and creating different effects for different types of weather.

### Day 3: January 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 Codewars challenges and made progress on FreeCodeCamp Local Weather App

**Thoughts:** I got both the geolocation and the weather API to work! Hurrah! Now the local weather displays in the app. I am trying to configure a reverse geocode lookup through a Google API to also display the user's city. I still need to make things pretty, but good progress!

### Day 1: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the FreeCodeCamp challenge to build a weather app

**Thoughts:** Was able to draft the intial html and css and get JS to prompt for the user's geolocaion; however, I've hit a roadblock with feeding the geolocation coordinates into the weather API. I can't even get them to display on the page!

### Day 0: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed my FreeCodeCamp challenge for the Random Quote Machine.

**Thoughts:** My biggest challenge was to get the Tweet button to dynamically respond to the content that is coming through the quote API. The content of the draft Tweet should change depending on what quote is generated through the API. Finally got this to work!
