# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed my FreeCodeCamp challenge for the Random Quote Machine.

**Thoughts:** My biggest challenge was to get the Tweet button to dynamically respond to the content that is coming through the quote API. The content of the draft Tweet should change depending on what quote is generated through the API. Finally got this to work!
